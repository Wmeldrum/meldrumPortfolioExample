History

We've all had our moments. Renowned east coast player, AD Sanford Kelly (Sagat) faced off against
Mentos sponsored Rico Suave (Abel) in Street Fighter 4 at Next Level
Battle Circuit <abbr> #66. The unnerving first-to-three match was fought to the last
possible round. It was looking to be Sanford's match, with a sizable 25% lead in health --
unbeknownst to us that history was to be made.
