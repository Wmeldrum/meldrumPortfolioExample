DATE PUBLISHED

History 

We've all had our moments. Renowned east coast player, AD Sanford Kelly faced off against
Mentos sponsored Rico Suave in Street Fighter 4 at Next Level
Battle Circuit #66. The unnerving first-to-three match was fought to the last
possible round. It was looking to be Sanford's match, with a sizable 25% lead in health,
unbeknownst to us that history was to be made.
